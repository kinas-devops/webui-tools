I'm an amateur enthusiast of the magic of AI image generation. Even though my computer is quite old and has an old video card with only 4Gb VRAM, I can do some experiments with Stable-Diffusion 1.5 and Stable-Diffusion XL models. I would like to share my experiences and learn a little more from those experienced in this interesting area of ​​AI.

Tools:
I started with the most popular version tool known as SD A1111, but I gradually realized that this tool was a bit slow in generating images and had not received updates for some time. So I ventured into new tools and my current favorite is SD reForge which can run reasonably well on low-resource machines.
