# webui-tools
I'm an amateur enthusiast of the magic of AI image generation using the powerful of Stable-Diffusion (2022) techniques. Even though my computer is quite old and has an old video card with only 4Gb VRAM (GTX 960 - 2015), I can do some experiments with Stable-Diffusion 1.5 (SD1.5-Oct2022) and Stable-Diffusion XL models (SDXL-Jul2023). I would like to share my experiences and learn a little more from those experienced in this interesting area of ​​AI.




**Tools:**
> I started with the most popular version tool known as SD A1111, but I gradually realized that this tool was a bit slow in generating images and had not received updates for some time. So I ventured into new tools and my current favorite is SD reForge which can run reasonably well on low-resource machines. Actually, there's a lot of tools that you can run on your personal computer to generate AI images. If you don't have NVIDIA graphics card with CUDA available, image generation takes a very long time to be processed. If you have an old NVIDIA graphics card like I have, images with SD 1.5 takes about 1 minute to be simple processed (without additional post processing) and with SD XL takes about 6 minutes to be simple processed. For begginners that don't want to manage tools with command line, I recommend to use Stabitility Matrix, a very powerful tool that can install everything for you and have a lot of tools available (including SD reForge).

**Models:**
> To work with AI image generation tools we need the essential checkpoint models files. These files contain all the necessary information to generate an image. They are large files, typically ranging from 2 to 7 GB, and no additional files are required to use them. These files are essential for generating images using Stable Diffusion models and can be installed and used in any SD WebUI GUI by placing the checkpoint model file in the appropriate folder and reloading the checkpoint dropbox. The best resources sites for download checkpoint models are CivitAI and Hugging Face.
